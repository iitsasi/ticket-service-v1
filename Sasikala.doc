Business decision situation: Obstacles that Indian national employees are facing today to get hired in USA seeks research help.
Current Situation: Hiring an Indian national employee in USA differs significantly from hiring a U.S citizen. The process of hiring requires the hiring unit to undergo a vast process to obtain the employment-based visa before the individual can work in the U.S. These visas would have a temporary time limit that would permit the employee to work for limited time and to a specific job position. Hiring units are responsible for processing these visas and are responsible for paying the filing fees. 
Symptoms: The hiring companies seem to prefer USA citizens over the Indian nationals. Some hiring companies hesitant to undergo the process of hiring Indian nationals because of the processing time and filing fees. 
Problem Statement: Are the skilled professionals in USA sufficient to perform the work. Even with the unemployment hovering around 9%, the hiring companies canâ€™t find the skilled workers to filling a position could take months of time. Are the immigrant employees have specific skills to perform the work?
Decision Statement: How can the immigrants overcome obstacles to find a right job in USA? Are the companies in USA willing to hire immigrant employees? Is there any necessity to redesign the regulations and procedure of hiring the foreign national employees in USA companies?
Research Objective: Indian Immigrants should find a job right from staying in India and understand the impacts of visa. The employee should get to know more about the location and who is sponsoring the visa. As a result the employees will be well prepared for the new situations and would be able to make decisions in different scenarios. There would be considerable amount of time from the point the employee file the visa and to the start date. The employees should ensure if the employer would wait for few months to have the work started. The companies would get lot of skilled labor and professions with the talent on a specific skill set. By enhancing the laws, it would be easier for the hiring units to hire the persons with some specific skill sets rather than finding an alternate approach to outsource the projects.
Research Questions: What should the immigrant supposed to do before filing for a work permit visa? How the hiring process need to be modified by the government so as to make the process easier by hiring units? What are the precautions to be taken care of the hiring units to avoid waiting time to onboard any candidate on work permit.
Research Hypothesis: There is need in America for the technological growth and the need of skilled labor to keep American businesses thriving. Visas are designed to allow U.S. companies to hire foreign workers in special occupations for limited periods of time. By not granting the sufficient visas, the government is forced to outsource the technological creativity. By redesigning the process, the staffing challenges will be met and bridge the talent gap by adding more resources to the organization.
